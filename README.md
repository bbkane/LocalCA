## Welcome to Local CA!  

Local CA is an open source self-hosted certificate authority that allows you to build your own [PKI infrastructure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_infrastructure) internally or in your homelab/home network. 
Say goodbye to those pesky HTTPS INSECURE  warnings when accessing you locally hosted web services! 
You can use the intuitive python django+bootstrap based web GUI to create and download root certificates, intermediate certificates and leaf/end user certificates to secure your services. 

With the certificates generated by Local CA, you can add HTTPs to your local instances Proxmox, Adguard Home, Pi-Hole, Jellyfin, Grafana, Homepag, Bitwarden etc. 

### Features
- Secure your home environment without the need for setting up proxies/port forwarding to use Let's Encrypt. 
- Create root, intermediate and leaf certificates. The root certificate is self signed, and you need to install it in your browser or client devices as a one time setup.  
- You can host the app locally and use the web UI to download certificates. 
- Simple and lightweight deployment using docker
- Use in Mutual TLS applications

## Quick Start - Deploy with pre-built docker image from docker hub 

Run the following two commands on any directory on your linux terminal to get Local CA up and running quickly.  (Note that you need to have [docker preinstalled](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) in your system). Do not expose this web app to the internet, it is for local use only.

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tgangte/LocalCA/refs/heads/main/docker-compose-from-registry.yml
docker compose up 
```
Visit the host's IP address or localhost IP [127.0.0.1](http://127.0.0.1/) on your browser. The default username and password are _admin_ and _password_. Change this promptly upon deployment. 

And the run the following command to manage the services:

```
 docker compose up -d   # to start the services in the background 
 docker compose down # to stop the services
```

### Development steps
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
cd localca_project
pip install -r requirements.txt

python manage.py makemigrations LocalCA

python manage.py migrate

python manage.py initadmin

python manage.py runserver
```
Build and deploy locally with the above instructions. Contributions are welcome! 

### Local build and deploy with docker

```
git clone https://github.com/tgangte/LocalCA.git 

#cd into  the directory that contains the docker-compose.yml file
cd LocalCA

# Run the docker compose build command, this will build and bring 'up' the app. 
sudo docker compose up --build

#Once build is satisfactory, run these to push to docker hub 
docker build -t practicalsre/local-ca:latest .
docker push practicalsre/local-ca
```
